```json
{
  "window.titleBarStyle": "custom",
  "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "titleBar.activeBackground": "#021526",
    "titleBar.activeForeground": "#41B3A2",
    "titleBar.inactiveBackground": "#0C0C0C",
    "titleBar.inactiveForeground": "#808080",
    "titleBar.border": "#021526"
  }
}
